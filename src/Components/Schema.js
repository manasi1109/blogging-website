The cause was almost certainly a solar storm of protons, electrons and ions -- called solar energetic particles, or SEPs -- although galactic gamma-ray bursts and supernovas would have left a similar chemical signature in the ice.</p>",

        Body: "<p>(Inside Science) -- Astronomers have detected the fastest-spinning white dwarf star found yet -- one that researchers say acts like an extraordinarily powerful magnetic propeller, a new study finds.</p><p>White dwarfs are stars that have burnt up all their fuel and shed their outer layers, leaving behind their cool, dim cores. Our sun will one day become a white dwarf, as will more than 90% of the stars in the Milky Way.</p><p>In the new study, researchers analyzed the white dwarf in the binary star system LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9. The white dwarf is a stellar remnant about 2,015 light-years from Earth that is roughly our planet's size but at least 230,000 times its mass. The researchers imaged the spinning of the star using the highly sensitive HiPERCAM instrument on the largest functioning optical telescope in the world, the 10-meter-wide Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain's Canary Islands.</p><p>The white dwarf's powerful gravity yanks plasma off its larger companion, a red dwarf star. In the past, this material fell onto the white dwarf's equator at high speed, resulting in its extraordinarily fast spin.</p><p>The white dwarf also possesses a strong magnetic field, which acts like a protective barrier that causes most of the plasma falling onto it to blast out from the dead star at speeds of roughly 6.7 million mph. This makes this stellar remnant only the second \"magnetic propeller\" white dwarf ever found, more than 70 years since the first.</p>",

Its secret is the iodine propellant it uses to maneuver in space.</p><p>The spacecraft, launched in 2020, is a type of miniaturized satellite called a CubeSat, weighing about 45 pounds (20 kilograms), and it's the first satellite to use iodine to convert electrical energy to ion propulsion.</p><p>The mission could pave the way for a new generation of smaller, cheaper spacecraft, according to a paper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04015-y\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 133, 23); background-color: transparent;\">published today</a>&nbsp;in the journal&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>.</p><p>More importantly, iodine fuel may also make it easier to equip more low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites with propellant, which could reduce the amount of future space junk, said plasma physicist Dmytro Rafalskyi, who is one of the paper's authors and works for the French aerospace and research company ThrustMe.</p><p>Presently, most small satellites orbiting Earth lack propellant. That's because the most common systems are either too expensive or too big to attach to a small satellite. Without propulsion, defunct satellites remain in space, adding to the tens of thousands of useless chunks of space debris.</p>",
